# OpenAI Integration Guide

## Overview
The BrandCamp API has been upgraded to use OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for website analysis with full Playwright MCP screenshot integration.

## Features

### ü§ñ OpenAI Service
- **GPT-4o-mini model** for faster, cost-effective analysis
- **Multimodal analysis** with screenshot support
- **Enhanced prompts** including performance metrics, SEO data, and accessibility scores
- **Automatic fallback** to MockAI service when no API key is provided

### üñºÔ∏è Screenshot Analysis
- Screenshots captured via Playwright MCP
- Visual analysis combined with HTML/metadata analysis
- Enhanced insights from actual rendered content

### üìä Enhanced Data Analysis
The AI now receives comprehensive data including:
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS), loading times, network data
- **SEO Analysis**: Structured data, meta tags, heading structure
- **Accessibility Scores**: Automated accessibility issue detection
- **Real Browser Data**: Live DOM analysis via Playwright

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Server Configuration  
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Service Selection
The system automatically chooses the appropriate AI service:
- **With OPENAI_API_KEY**: Uses OpenAIService with GPT-4o-mini
- **Without API key**: Falls back to MockAIService for development

## Usage

### Basic Analysis
```typescript
import { OpenAIService } from './services/aiService';

const aiService = new OpenAIService();
const result = await aiService.analyzeWebsite(websiteData, 'Value Proposition', prompt);
```

### Screenshot Analysis
```typescript
// If websiteData contains a screenshot, analysis will be multimodal
const result = await aiService.analyzeWithScreenshot(websiteData, 'CTA Analysis', prompt);
```

## API Response Structure
